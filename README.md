# Demos

A collection of demos for basic functionality using .NET Core.

## Projects

This repository contains several sample projects.

### EncryptDecryptBase64

A sample C# code that will take a string and encrypt it using AES. Then, convert it to Base64,
so it can be sent as a HttpRequest parameter. The project also decrypt the encrypted result string 
after converting it back from Base64 to demonstrate it works.

### PKCS#7 Padding

A sample C# code that demonstrates how to use PKCS#7 padding to pad a string to a multiple of 11 bytes
and then reverses the padding to get the original string.
